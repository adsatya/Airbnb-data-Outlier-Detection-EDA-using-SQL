# Airbnb-data-Outlier-Detection-EDA-using-SQL
The way people experience cities around the world has been completely transformed by Airbnb in the fields of contemporary travel and hospitality. Airbnb provides a variety of lodging options, ranging from comfortable private rooms to roomy entire apartments, as an online marketplace that connects hosts with travelers. The European Booking Dataset, a thorough compilation of information from nine renowned cities—Amsterdam, Athens, Barcelona, Berlin, Budapest, Lisbon, Paris, Rome, and Vienna—is the subject of this project. The dataset has undergone meticulous curation and cleaning, making it a useful tool for analysis and insight.

This project's main goals are to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), identify outliers in the dataset, and determine any possible causal links between outliers and guest satisfaction. In order to identify patterns, trends, and elements that affect visitors' overall experiences, we will combine data from various cities and Airbnb stays. We use SQL queries within the Snowflake environment to accomplish this, allowing us to quickly process and analyze large amounts of data.
